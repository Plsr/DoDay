# DoDay ✅

A minimalist todo app. No lists and project, just things you want to do toady. What is not completed will be removed from your list at midnight. You have a chance to import it for the next day, if you don't, its gone forever.

The concept was inspired by [Jason Freid](https://lifehacker.com/im-jason-fried-ceo-of-basecamp-and-this-is-how-i-work-1790556608):

> I have a small handful of things I know I need to do every day. If I can’t keep them in my head, I have too many things to do.

## Backgorund
I [built this for the web in Vue.js](https://github.com/Plsr/DoDee) a few years ago to learn Vue for a client project. I recently remembered that it existed and I wanted to do a React Native project on the side again, so here we are.

## Todo:
### Now
- [ ] Design
- [x] Allow todos to be checked off
